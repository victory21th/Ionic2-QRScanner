# Ionic 2 QRScanner

## Setup

Steps:
- `npm install`
- `ionic state restore` (Check out [Ionic State](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli#ionic-state))

After these commands, your application is all ready to be built and deployed to the platform of your choice.

_WINDOWS NOTICE_: For those who have a Windows machine, the `ionic platform add ios` command will fail when running `ionic state restore`.

_ANDROID NOTICE_: For those who would like to build on Android, just simply run `ionic platform add android` after `ionic state restore` finishes to add the platform.
